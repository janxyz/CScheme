** Symbols
Symbols are objects that are identical if their names are spelled the same way.
The usual way to implement symbols is to use a symbol table to keep track of all
the symbols used by the program.
** Empty list object
There is only one empty list object. It can be checked with the ~null?~ predicate.
** Pairs
Pairs are objects containing two other objects.
* C programming
** TODO Read about const correctness in regard to return types
